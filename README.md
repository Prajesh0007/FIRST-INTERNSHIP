# FIRST-INTERNSHIP
I completed my 1st internship at CT IT Solutions, where I worked on AI projects, including text summarization, speech-to-text, and neural style transfer. I gained hands-on experience in Python and NLP while developing functional systems. This internship enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of AI applications.
